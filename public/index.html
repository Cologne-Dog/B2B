					<h3 class="content__item-subtitle">"We got our start by helping a friend in need."</h3>
					<div class="content__item-text">
						<p>We got our start by helping a friend in need. That friend was an awesome dog named Leo who had a body odor issue, but was too sensitive for traditional deodorants. The spirit of helping a friend is what drives us, and we would love to help you out with Solvent-Free Solutions™.</p>
						<p>Leo could not stand off the shelf pet deodorants, the smell hurt him, and he was afraid of those products. So there was when we were born, as a formula to help Leo that through the discovery of science was shown to preserve the pesticidal and healing potentials of essential oils and other chemicals.</p>
						<p>In 2019, Cologne.Dog™ patented the "Lowest-Toxicity Strategy™" for manufacturing multipurpose fragrances. Today, Cologne.Dog™ is a U.S. chemical company specializing in this method for producing the safest oil and water emulsions in the world. We are based in Los Angeles, minutes away from the Van Nuys airport.</p>

					<h3 class="content__item-subtitle">Biochemistry principles, applied to sustainable and responsible manufacturing.</h3>
					<div class="content__item-text">
						<p>The biochemistry of live animals provided all the keys for the decisions we made in our approach. Benign fatty acids are molecules that animals store in abundance. The molecules are characterized as long carbon chain molecules with low volatility and little or no electrical imbalance, known as polarity in organic chemistry. </p>
						<p>In contrast, solvents are short carbon chain molecules that are highly volatile, often driven by significant electrical imbalances within their structures. The longer the carbon chain, the more buffer it provides for the electrical imbalances of its constituent atoms. Since the short chain molecules lack this buffer, their volatility is high, thus, causing undesirable effects to live tissues that include the formation of cancers.</p>
						<p>The difference between these two classes (short-carbon chain molecules with high volatility and long-carbon chain molecules with low volatility) can be detected by their combustability. While fatty acids are not combustable, solvents are.</p>
						<p>The benefits of eliminating solvents extends beyond protection against their damages to sensitive live tissues. Solvents also damage the pesticidal and healing potentials of essential oils and other chemicals. Our system preserves the anti-microbial, anti-fungal, anti-parasitic, anti-viral, and healing potentials of essential oils and other chemicals. Our products can be purposed as the world's safest oil and water emulsions for:</p>

							<li>Personal Fragrances</li>

						<p>Solvents are traditionally known to mix oil and water to produce single layer products, as is often the case for fragrances. However, this comes at a cost. Environmentally, solvent manufacturing has been identified as the leading polluting process in all industrial societies (). Solvent use is regulated by the EPA and OSHA, among others, and solvents are known toxins that damage live tissues and cause cancer.</p>
						<p>Ergonomically, solvents are not tolerated by a significant proportion of the human population, and the entire population of non-human mammals. For this reason, solvent-based fragrances are often banned from the workplace and professional settings, such as hospitals and clinics.</p>
						<p>The Cologne.Dog™ approach addresses these pain points in fragrance manufacturing. Our oil and water emulsions maintain the strong aromatic properties of oils, while not causing surfaces to become oily. Indeed, Cologne.Dog™ products are hydrating and do not trap dirt or cause grime.</p>
						<p>Furthermore, no solvents also extends benefits to the environment and to those exposed to fragrances. Our method is not damaging to the environment, and do not cause damage to live tissues. As a result, the Cologne.Dog™ system delivers pleasant and joyful experiences that tap in to the benefits of aromatherapy while preserving the pesticidal and healing qualities of essential oils and constituent components of formulas that can be purposed for various use cases.</p>
						<p>As a <strong>general purpose deodorizer</strong>, Cologne.Dog™ technologies delivers deodorizing solutions for regulated workplace and hospitality settings that limit the use of fragrances due to their irritating effects.</p>

						<p>The Cologne.Dog™ system maintains the pesticidal potential of essential oils for their use as biological cleansers. On their own, essential oils may be damaging or caustic to surfaces. It is always advised to dilute essential oils prior to their use to avoid these damages.</p>
						<p>Traditionally, essential oils would be diluted in other oils or in water with the presence of solvents. Our system provides a new dimension to the possibilities of creating oil and water emulsions that are hydrating, that do not leave surfaces oily, and that preserve the pesticidal potential of essential oils.</p>
						<p>Please check out the references section for bleeding edge (up-to-date) scientific literature proving the natural pesticidal potential of essential oils. This is the primary mechanism of cleansing biological tissues for use cases including wounds, vaginosis, and others.</p>

						<p>The skin is the largest organ of mammalian bodies. Furthermore, the skin is a potent route of entry for chemicals, also known as topical delivery. Very recent peer-reviewed studies have begun to highlight the damages caused to the healing and therapeutic properties of essential oils and other chemicals including ascorbate, and others.</p>
						<p>The Cologne.Dog™ system <strong>eliminates damages to healing components</strong> of formulas that are created with our Lowest-Toxicity Strategy™ for manufacturing fragrances. <strong>The Cologne.Dog™ system optimizes the maintenance of the healing and therapeutic potential of various chemicals, including essential oils</strong></p>
						<p>Cologne.Dog, Inc. is lead by a stem cell scientist who specialized in the differentiation of adult ectodermal (i.e. skin) stem cells to a collagen producing lineage. We know more than others what it takes for the skin to heal, maintain, regenerate, and rejuvinate from a variety of conditions including aging and sun damage.</p>
						<p>Furthermore, our scientific staff is trained in medical science, and able to cooperatively purpose any variety of therapeutic products as a topical delivery with our one-of-a-kind oil and water emulsion system. We have general purpose and custom unique formulations available to offer leading partners in the spaces of personal care, beauty, and health.</p>
